          The beagle breed is a small scent hound, similar in appearance to the
          much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting
          hare known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior
          tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a
          detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in
          quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent and is a
          popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited
          health problems.
