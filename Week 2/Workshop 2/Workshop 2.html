    <p>The beagle breed is a small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. 
    The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare known as beagling. 
    Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. 
    The beagle is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
