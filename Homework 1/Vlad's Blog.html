      <p>My current job is Customer Support Agent for Honor UK in Cluj-Napoca, here is a short story of what I've done since day one.</p>
      </Head>
      <body>
      <div>Childhood<img src="Childhood.png" height="30" alt="Childhood"></div>
            <p>Born on the 15th of March in Cluj-Napoca, went to primary school (where I developed an affinity with Geography and English) in Floresti (which is now sadly the most populated village in Romania). 
                What was 20 years ago a field full of crops is now an entire neighbourhood inhabited by more than 50 thousand people.
            Life in Floresti consisted in playing lots of football, spending time with my older brother Tudor, playing hide&seek with our friends and getting hurt and scratches(which are evident on my body even now) by playing other kid's games. </p>
            
         <div>Study years and first job<img src="Student.png" height="20" alt="Study"></div>
         <p>Finished high school and university in Cluj-Napoca. Majored in Environmental Science at Babes-Bolyai University.
            After putting a great effort landing a job in this field without success, got hired at a classic car restoration shop, which lifted my interest in classic cars. 
         My main role was to find cars and parts online for my Manager, a "car nut", especially the ones produced by Italian and French carmakers. 
         One of my favourite cars found during my work here was a 1967 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maserati_Mistral" target="_blank">Maserati Mistral</a>, which is one of the few produced with an aluminium body.</p>
         <div>Marriage<img src="Marriage.jpg" height="20" alt="Marriage"></div>
         <p>Met Diana in 2014 whilst she was working in a pharmacy close to where I was living. Warm, quick-minded and good looking was all I needed to have interest in knowing her better. 
            After 3 visits in her pharmacy in which I came up with all kinds of problems that made no sense, I invited her for a cup of coffee, which she accepted after playing hard to get. 
            We instantly hit it off and started doing everything together like trips, vacations, playing tennis, etc.
            <span style=color:red>Got married in the same year.(waw!)</span></p>
         <div>Away in the UK <img src="UK Flag.jpg" height="12" alt="UK flag"></div>
         <p>I felt we were hitting a plateau in Romania and proposed to try and live in the UK, which sounded great for Diana too.
            New culture, rythym and kind people suited our lifestyle. Jobs were easy to find, I worked as a Customer Support Agent for a bank and she was a Dispenser in a local pharmacy. 
            Had the opportunity to travel a lot around <a href="https://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/come-to-england.jpg" target="_blank">England</a> and to take city breaks in Europe, which we enjoyed to the fullest. We also had an active social life, and started making strong connections with the natives.
            In 2020 the Coronavirus stopped us from doing almost anything. But that didn't stop us from having our first baby. 
            After two awful and hurtful miscarriages , in June 2021 we were blessed with our son Lucas, born in Milton Keynes, UK :)
         </p>
         <div>Back to Romania <img src="Romania.png" height="12" alt="Romania flag"></div>
         <p>The combination of being away from home and being in lockdown forced us to make a big step and return to our homeland at the end of 2021.
            We thought it will be a really easy step to take, after all, it's back to where we were born and lived for 30 years. But things have changed, and not in a good sense. 
            People are short tempered, the city is polluted, crowded and noisy. Access to nature, which is one of our hobbies is a long way from Cluj, especially when you're ridding in the car with a toddler.
            But we hope we will find our way back to normal here.

            <ul type="circle">
             <li>Football</li><p>At around 10 I discovered I had a football field just a few minutes away from my place. 
                I used to spend many hours there, especially during summertime. If I was all by myself I would practice free kicks and dribble past imaginary players. Since then this sport's been my favourite activity. I'm a Barca fan.</p>
             <li>Tennis</li><p>Been hitting the green ball ocasionally very early in my life, it's a sport that requires lots of practice in order to have a correct contact with the ball</p>
             <li>Reading(books)</li><p>An avid reader since high school, my first book read that I remember was Morometii. 
               Nowadays I like reading biographies of famous people, last one to read was about Andre Agassi, which was briliant and inspiring.</p>
             <li>Classic cars</li><p>As mentioned above, this passion for cars hasn't faded yet, even though I'm not in the classic car field anymore. 
                My dream is to buy a project car and restore it from scratch. I would start with a small coupe, like a Fiat 850 Sport from the 60's</p>
